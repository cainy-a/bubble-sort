# Hello There!
## This is the site for my C# implementations of some sorting algorithms.
I have some algorithms already, but I will work on making more.
### Why not [download for Windows](https://github.com/cainy-a/bubble-sort/releases) or use a button above to get the source code, which is ready for Visual Studio with no changes.
## Sorting algorithm status
### Completed
Bubble, Selection, Counting
### Work In Progress
Rewrite Bubble and Selection to use more efficient logic.
