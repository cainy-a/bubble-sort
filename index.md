# Hello There!
## This is the site for my C# implementations of some sorting algorithms.
I have some algorithms already, but I will work on making more/improving existing ones.
### [Releases (Windows)](https://github.com/cainy-a/bubble-sort/releases)
Alternatively, use a button above to get the source code.
## Sorting algorithm status
### Completed
Bubble (w/ Improved Logic), Selection, Counting (w/ Improved Logic)
### Work In Progress
Rewrite Selection to use more efficient logic.
